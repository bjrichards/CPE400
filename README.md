# Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network

## Prompt
The team will simulate a mesh network where nodes and links may fail (Figure 5). Nodes and links may fail intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.
