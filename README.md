# Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network

## Prompt
The team will simulate a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.

## Required Resources
```
Python3
```
## To Run from Terminal
From the project directory, run the following command in the terminal (note: must use Python 3):

python3 main.py

You should then be presented with the user-menu and be able to execute the simulation.
