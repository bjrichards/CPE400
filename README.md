# Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network

## Prompt
The team will simulate a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.

## Required Resources
```
Python3
```
## To Run from Terminal
From the project directory, run the following command in the terminal (note: must use Python 3):

python3 main.py

You should then be presented with the user-menu and be able to execute the simulation.

## To Do
Due to circumstances that occurred the day this project was due, I ended up needing to recreate this project in a short time span (~2 hours), so therefore the comments are lacking, the main function is rather horrendous looking since it contains most the code of the menu, and the program as a whole is hard to read through. So as I get free time I am planning to refactor large portions of the project to increase readability and presentation.
